My take on the famous Breakout game released by Atari in 1976.

## How to play
The goal of the game is to break the bricks with your ball, while preventing the ball from falling down with the bat.
At the start of the game, press SPACE to launch the ball. You can move the bat by using the arrow keys (LEFT and RIGHT).
Be careful, you lose a life whenever the ball touches the bottom of the screen. If you run out of lives, you lose the game.
If you manage to break all bricks with the ball, you win the game!

## Install
 1. `mvn clean install` on the main project
 2. `mvn exec:java` to run the game
